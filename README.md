# Petals-Metal-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This is an independent project about deep learning.
The data uses the Kaggle challenge Petal-Metal, the challenge here is to use a data set in tf format to predict plant classes (104 classes).
My developement goes step by step from very basic to advanced methods for deep learning.
